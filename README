A small Node.js program that reads the MQTT server where you have connected OpenwebRX to read the topics OpenwebRX/CLIENT and OpenwebRX/RX 
and send a message to your Telegram when someone connects with their IP, country, ISP, frequency, and profile. It also notifies you when 
they disconnect.

For example, when a client connects, you will receive a Telegram notification with details such as:

IP: 78.138.82.254

Country: Spain

City: Ciudad Lineal

ISP: Aire Networks del Mediterraneo

Frequency: (Frequency details from OpenwebRX/RX)

Profile: (Profile details from OpenwebRX/CLIENT)

When the client disconnects, you'll receive another notification indicating the disconnection.

You have a config.js file where you need to put the Telegram token, chatID, and the configuration of your MQTT server.

Dependencies:

The standard library modules (console.log, Date, async/await, JSON) are included with Node.js, so we don't need to install them separately.

Third-party libraries (mqtt, axios, node-telegram-bot-api) need to be installed. Here is the command to install these dependencies:

 npm install mqtt axios node-telegram-bot-api
